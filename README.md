Compiled Version (Hackathon Version) - LeapStart

We lost the source files for this specific compiled version that was our final as far as we got. However, we added in the partial source code from what was last saved before the big jump. Lesson learned: Always Ctrl + S, even if you build because you never know when the dreaded BSOD hits you.

The game was built on top of the Unity LeapMotionSDK Example application. The idea is a counterintuitive game ie. why one of the proposed names was "LeapOfFaith" that was replaced with LeapStart, as in taking a leap and going against your better judgement and being rewarded for it. The idea that sometimes we have to take risks and reap the rewards of what we sow. This was more so us playing around with Unity and learning how to do basic things and interact with the Leap Motion sensor after we had hardware compatibility issues with the Oculus Rift.
